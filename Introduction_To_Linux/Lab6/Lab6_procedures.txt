1. Create directory Lab6.

2. Create a shortcut named myLs which will work exactly like the command ls.

3. Create a shortcut named LsL, which will execute ls -l.

4. Create a shortcut which will first go to the home directory, then go to directory Lab6 and then will show the contain of Lab6.

5. Using redirection, put the aliases which were created by you in 2-4, into file MyAlias.sh in Lab6 (see example in Note 1).

Run the file and check that it works properly (see Note 2).

Notes:
1). The file MyAlias.sh should contain the definitions of the alias and their runs.
2). To run MyAlias.sh, instead of the usual method ./MyAlias.sh, use
source MyAlias.sh.
Why? Because when we use the normal ./ method, the subshell is opened and
the definitions of the new commands obtained from the alias are not saved in
the global shell. So, in this case you won't see the alias results. However, when
a source command is used, we continue to work in the global shell. So all the
new settings are saved there.

6. In Lab6 create file named WritersFile which contains the First names, Second names, years of birth, countries of birth of 5 famous writers.
The fields will be separated by *
For example, one line of this file can be:
Lewis*Carroll*1832*England

7. Sort the WritersFile
(a) by the first name and put the result into the file SortedByFirstName.
(b) by the country of birth and put the result into the file SortedByCountry.
(c) by the year of birth in increasing order and put the result into the file SortedByYearInc.
(d) by the year of birth in decreasing order and put the result into the file SortedByYearDec.

8. Define array named TestArray and put in its first field the first and the
second name of one of the authors you like. In the second field its year of birth.
And in the third field the country of his birth.
Print the contain of TestArray and its length. (Use @ and #)
Then redirect all the commands of TestArray, used above, into a file
TestArrayFile.sh in Lab6. Run this file and check.

9. In Lab6 write bash script named MathArray.sh which is doing the following:
- Ask for the positive number and put it into NUM
- Ask for NUM numbers and define array which contains these numbers.
- Go throgh the array and sum the values. Then print the sum of the array.
- Go throgh the array, find and print the maximum of array.

10. In Lab6 write bash script named Files.sh which is looking for all the files
which contain the letter k and then change their name so they finish with the
running number, strating with 1. The resulting list of the files will be written in
the increasing order of the symbol which comes after the letter k in file FileList.
