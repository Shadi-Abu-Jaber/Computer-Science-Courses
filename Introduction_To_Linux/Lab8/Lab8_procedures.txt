1.Create directory Lab8.

2. 
a) Create file StudentsFile which contains the First name, Second name, year of birth and GPA 
(Grade point average) of at least 7 students. The fields will be separated by spaces.

b) Write a function calcStdNames which receives as a parameter StudentsFile and prints the first names
of the students and number of the students with this name. The output should be sorted by the name in alphabet order.

For example, if StudentsFile is: 

Moshe Porat 1990 85.4
Irit Rup 2002 74.2
Moshe Moshonov 1998 56.3 
Olga Ivanova 1999 82.1 
Muhamad Haib 2001 86.7 
Moshe Perez 2006 92.3 
Muhamad Musa 2005 75.3

Then calcStdNames will print 1 Irit
3 Moshe
2 Muhamad
1 Olga

c) Write a function CalcGPA which receives as parameters StudentsFile and number YEAR in
a range 1900-2010 (check that input is valid) and prints list of the students from StudentsFile 
which were born during YEAR year. The list will be sorted by the GPA.

d). Write a script studentChecker.sh which receives as a parameter StudentsFile,
calls the function calcStdNames and puts the results into a file Names.txt. 
Then the script calls the function CalcGPA and puts the results into a file GPA.txt.


3. Write a script checkPythonFile.sh that accepts two parameters: a python file and a text file.
The script runs the python file and puts the results into file named as the python file,
without .py plus Result.txt and compares the result with a given text file. If there are no differences
between the files, the script prints “Your python code is correct”. Otherwise, it prints ”Your python code is wrong.”

4. Write a script named UniqD.sh which accepts a file (the file can be unsorted) and implements the Linux command uniq -d.
Note: the commands uniq (with any flags) and sort -u can not be used in the script.

5. Hi-tech company Moogle has decided to open a new branch in Haifa, announced a day of interviews at
the Faculty of Computer Science in Tel-Hai. There are several interviewers, including the Moogle manager.
Each interviewer gives a score for the interviewee between 0 and 100.
The final grade will be determined by weighting all the grades.
The manager has a right of veto: an interviewee to whom the manager has given a NO can not be accepted for the job.
At the end of the interviews, each interviewer prepares a file in the following format about the people he interviewed .
Here there are 4 fields separated by spaces. The name of the file is <interviewer's name>.grades.

For example, File eyal.grades:
031243129 Moshe Levi 60
444422267 Shimon Cohen 90 
555782311 David David 100

File Moogle.grades:
031243129 Moshe Levi 57 
555782311 David David -NO- 
444422267 Shimon Cohen 80

Write a script called BestToWork.sh that checks these .grades files and return the best group of interviewees.
The script will receive as a parameter the number of places and will return such a number of outstanding
(with a highest score) interviewees sorted by degree of success.
If there are not enough interviewees who have been interviewed / passed the interview,
the script will print a message: "Not enough interviewees"

For example, for the running: >BestToWork.sh 2
On the two files in the example, we get:
1) 444422267 Shimon Cohen
2) 031243129 Moshe Levy

Notes:
- Assume that the existing input files are correct
- It can be assumed that the same interviewers interviewed all the people
