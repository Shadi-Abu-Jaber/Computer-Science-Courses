# Systems Programming course 

 ## Exercise 1:
 * Program designed to analyze DNA sequences and motifs, evaluates whether the provided sequence
   is a gene or a CRISPR spacer and verifies the legality of the input motif.
 * Upon execution, it prompts the user for input, conducts the analyses,
   and outputs the occurrences of the motif within the sequence.






 ## Exercise 2:
 * reading and processing fasta files (files that contains a DNA sequences) then print each DNA sequence Detailes like
   Sequence name, length, percentage of  appearance of 'C' and 'G', number of times 'N' appeared.
   
 * Note: In FASTA format the line before the DNA sequence, called the FASTA definition line, must begin with a carat (">")

 ## Exercise 5:
 * Phonbook Program :)
   
## Exercise 6:
 * A program that simulates the story of Moses
 * Quick summary:
    * In this exercise, we will help the people of Israel to make a system
      that will keep in a data structure all the children in Egypt and look after Moses
      until he reaches the age of 80 and saves Israel.
    * The midwives gave birth to the Hebrew women and thus children were born.
    * Pharaoh decreed that the males be thrown into the river.
    * Moses' mother hid him as long as she could so that he would not be killed.
    * At the age of 80, Moses freed the people of Israel from Egypt.
