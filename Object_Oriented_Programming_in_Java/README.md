- Object-oriented planning and programming - the supremacy of form over content.
  Introduction, what are objects and what is object-oriented programming. The history of programming until OOP.

- Objects, classes, constructors and other vegetables, types. How to say it in Java : The Java syntax

- Containers - objects that are used as containers for other objects. A basic tool in the programmer's toolbox.
  What is the difference between them and arrays. Details of container types: array, queue, stack, map.

- Generic programming (Generics) What does the container need to know about the objects it contains? Sometimes more than just their number. What problems may arise due to over- or under-rating of the contained object types, and how to resolve them.

- Exceptions In real programs it is possible that 70% of the code handles edge cases. How do you separate it from the code dealing with the algorithm? Handling errors, input errors, exception situations and other edge cases in Java (and other modern languages) is done through exceptions.

- Packages (Packages) It is rarely possible to implement an entire program in a single file. How do you connect multiple files (perhaps multiple files) into one application? How do you distribute such an application?

- Handling files (Streams) Input and output in Java is not as simple as in other languages, but there is a reason for that. The implementation is very clean and allows a convenient choice of the desired features without paying for unnecessary features, using the decoration template.

- Threads What is a plan, what is a process and what is a thread? How can threads make better use of computer resources, and what dangers lurk in programs that use threads to do so?

- Design Patterns methods for efficient and correct implementation of common programming tasks, while utilizing the capabilities of OOP languages. We met many of them during the course, and here we will summarize their features and limitations. This subject will be studied according to the time left.
